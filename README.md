# R_linear_mixed_model_project_ECT_PANSS_project
A project that I worked on for statistically analyze data after electroconvulsive therapy and assess PANSS scores

Due to clustered data (repeated measures for patients), I decided to use a linear mixed effects approach with each patient taken as a random intercept.
